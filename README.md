## Project Overview  
This repository contains the code and methodology for our machine learning project aimed at predicting Formula 1 (F1) race winners and optimizing pit stop strategies. The project leverages advanced ML techniques and datasets spanning F1 races from 1950 to 2024 to develop predictive models that assist in strategic decision-making.

---

## Features  
- **Winner Prediction Model:** Predicts the winner based on circuit, grid positions, and other race conditions using logistic regression with class balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE).  
- **Pit Stop Strategy Optimizer:** Uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to identify the optimal number of pit stops and strategies for a race.  
- **Comprehensive Data Handling:** Preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced datasets for robust predictions.  
- **Visualizations:** Correlation plots, learning curves, ROC curves, and more for in-depth model evaluation.

## Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, containing historical F1 race data from 1950-2024, including:  
- Driver and constructor stats  
- Circuit details  
- Lap times, pit stops, and results  

For more details, refer to the [dataset source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020).

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Dropped irrelevant features and standardized numerical values for model compatibility.  
- Addressed class imbalance with SMOTE and weighted logistic regression.  

### 2. Pit Stop Strategy Model  
- **Architecture:** Enhanced MLP with ELU activation, Batch Normalization, and Dropout.  
- **Training:** Multi-class cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, early stopping.  

### 3. Winner Prediction Model  
- Logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch.  
- K-fold cross-validation for performance assessment.
